## Data availability

Raw sequencing data: NCBI BioProject **[PRJNA385349](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA385349)** **[PRJNA725510](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA725510)**  **[PRJNA607233](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA607233)** and additional datasets listed in the manuscript (Table S1).  
Due to size, raw and processed genomic data are not stored in this repository.  
Scripts assume you have downloaded and organized data locally — see `data/README.md`.
